## Front end development

Make sure you have NodeJS, and if you don't have it already, install gulp.js globally with:

```sh
$ npm install -g gulp
```

Before you can use the gulpfile, you need to install the dependencies by running:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Now you can build the front end with:

```sh
$ gulp build
```

And you can use the debug mode with:

```sh
$ gulp
```
